Integrates [Serenata](https://gitlab.com/Serenata/Serenata) into Atom as PHP IDE, providing autocompletion, code navigation, refactoring, signature help, linting and annotations.

See also [the website](https://serenata.gitlab.io/) for [how to set it up](https://serenata.gitlab.io/#what-do-i-need) and screenshots.

There is also [a wiki](https://github.com/Gert-dev/php-ide-serenata/wiki) with more information.

Note that this package is an alternative to and will conflict with the [ide-php](https://atom.io/packages/ide-php) package by default (you can disable parts of this package via the settings screen if desired).
