# Paramore: From All We Know Is Falling to Riot!
 
Paramore is one of the most successful and influential bands in the pop-punk and emo scene. Their debut album, *All We Know Is Falling*, was released in 2005 by Fueled by Ramen Records and introduced the world to the powerful vocals of Hayley Williams and the catchy riffs of Josh and Zac Farro. The album was inspired by the departure of bassist Jeremy Davis and dealt with themes of loss, betrayal, and hope. It featured songs like "Pressure", "Emergency", and "My Heart", which showcased the band's raw energy and emotion. The album received positive reviews from critics and fans alike, and earned them a spot on the Warped Tour.
 
However, it was their sophomore album, *Riot!*, that catapulted them to mainstream success and recognition. Released in 2007, *Riot!* was a more polished and confident effort that expanded the band's sound and appeal. It contained hit singles like "Misery Business", "Crushcrushcrush", and "That's What You Get", which dominated the charts and airwaves. The album also received critical acclaim and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist. *Riot!* sold over two million copies worldwide and established Paramore as one of the leading bands of their generation.

The album was darker and more mature than their previous works, and featured songs like "Ignorance", "Brick by Boring Brick", and "The Only Exception".

The album experimented with different genres and influences, such as pop, rock, funk, and gospel. It also included interludes and collaborations with other artists. The album spawned hits like "Still Into You", "Ain't It Fun", and "Daydreaming". The album was a critical and commercial success, winning a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song for "Ain't It Fun".

In 2017, Paramore released their fifth and latest album, *After Laughter*, which further explored their pop sensibilities and influences. The album was heavily inspired by the 1980s new wave and synth-pop music, and featured songs like "Hard Times", "Told You So", and "Fake Happy". The album also dealt with themes of depression, anxiety, and self-doubt, contrasting the upbeat melodies with the dark lyrics. The album received rave reviews from critics and fans, who praised the band's honesty and creativity. The album also marked the return of Zac Farro on drums, who rejoined the band after reconciling with Williams and York.
