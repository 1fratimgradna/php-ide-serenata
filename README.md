Integrates [PHP Integrator](https://gitlab.com/php-integrator/core) into Atom, providing autocompletion, code navigation, refactoring, signature help, linting and annotations.

See also [the website](https://php-integrator.github.io/) for screenshots.

Note that the heavy lifting is performed by the [PHP core](https://gitlab.com/php-integrator/core), which is automatically installed as _payload_ for this package and kept up to date automatically.

## What do I need to do to make it work?
