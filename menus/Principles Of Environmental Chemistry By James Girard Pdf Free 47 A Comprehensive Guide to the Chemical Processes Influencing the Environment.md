# Review: Principles of Environmental Chemistry by James Girard
 
Environmental chemistry is a branch of chemistry that studies the interactions of chemical substances with the natural environment. It covers topics such as atmospheric chemistry, water chemistry, soil chemistry, biogeochemical cycles, pollution, and remediation. Principles of Environmental Chemistry by James Girard is a textbook that aims to provide a comprehensive and accessible introduction to this field for undergraduate students.
 
The book is divided into four parts: Part I covers the basic concepts and tools of environmental chemistry, such as chemical reactions, equilibrium, thermodynamics, kinetics, and acid-base chemistry. Part II focuses on the chemistry of the atmosphere, including the structure and composition of the atmosphere, ozone depletion, greenhouse effect, photochemical smog, and acid rain. Part III deals with the chemistry of water, including the properties and classification of water, dissolved oxygen, aquatic life, water pollution, and water treatment. Part IV explores the chemistry of soil and sediments, including soil formation and composition, nutrient cycles, organic matter, pesticides, and hazardous waste.
